# Algorithms-Assignments-Coursera
## Algorithms Toolbox Course
This course covers a lot of computational problems we face in real life applications like: sorting algorithms, searching, divide and conquer,and greedy algorithms.
## Assigments 
The assignments we deal with in the course, they help the learner to master different sorting techniques like merge sort and quick sort and how to optimize it to sort faster
when dealing with large dataset. Also, other problems like divide and conquer to learn by stress training to be powerful enough on how to split programmatically problems into subproblems
using recursions and helped to be powerful in __recursive functions processes__ when I work with debugging.
Also, dealing with __Greed algorithm__ and find safe move, and __Fibbonacci Numbers and Playing with them__
